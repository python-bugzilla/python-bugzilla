Hackers Guide
=============

1. Setting up the environment
-----------------------------
To start development, you can set-up/activate a virtual environment by using
the following command:
    source contrib/activate-dev-env [python2|python3]

Note: Providing no arguments will attempt to use python2.

# Manually activating an environment
    source dev-env-${NAME}/bin/activate

2. Running tests
----------------
Once you have already activated an environment, you can use the following.

# Basic unit test suite
    python setup.py test

# Functional tests
There are more comprehensive tests that are disabled by default. Readonly
functional tests that run against several public bugzilla instances. No
login account is required:

    python setup.py test --ro-functional

And read/write functional tests. These currently run against the test
bugzilla instance at partner-bugzilla.redhat.com, and requires a valid
login there:

    python setup.py test --rw-functional

Note: Before running rw-functional tests, make sure you have logged using:
    python bugzilla-cli \
        --bugzilla=partner-bugzilla.redhat.com \
        --user=$USER login

3. pylint and pep8
------------------
To test for pylint or pep8 violations, you can run:
    python setup.py pylint

Note: This expects that you already have pylint and pep8 (installed when setting
up virtualenv) installed.

4. Patch Submission
-------------------
If you are submitting a patch, ensure the following:
    [REQ] verify that no new pylint or pep8 violations
    [REQ] run basic unit test suite across all python versions:
            bash contrib/run-tests

Running any of the functional tests is not a requirement for patch submission,
but please give them a go if you are interested.
