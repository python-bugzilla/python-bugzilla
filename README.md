# python-bugzilla

This package provides two bits:

* 'bugzilla' python module for talking to a [Bugzilla](https://www.bugzilla.org/) instance over XMLRPC
* /usr/bin/bugzilla command line tool for performing actions from the command line: create or edit bugs, various queries, etc.

This was originally written specifically for Red Hat's Bugzilla instance
and is used heavily at Red Hat and in Fedora, but it should still be
generically useful.

You can find some code examples in the [examples](examples) directory
